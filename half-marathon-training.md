- **Tempo Runs**: This is a continuous run with a buildup in the middle to near 10-K race pace. A Tempo Run of 30 to 45 minutes would begin with 10-15 minutes easy running, shifting smoothly into an acceleration of 15-20 minutes near the middle, then 5-10 minutes easy toward the end. The pace buildup should be gradual, not sudden, with peak speed coming about two-thirds into the workout. Hold that peak only for a minute or two. The times prescribed for Tempo Runs serve mainly as rough guidelines. Feel free to improvise. Improvisation is the heart of doing a Tempo Run correctly.
- Most runs unless they are speedwork should be done at least 30 seconds to 90 seconds than race pace.

### Speed Workouts
- Fartlek: Alternate between running at fast and slow paces. A good fartlek might be 0.5 mile at race pace or faster and then 0.5 miles at an easy pace on repeat. 
- 400m Intervals: Run 400m at a pace faster than your race pace and then jog for 1-2 minutes after. Repeat 6-8 times. Start at around 75% intensity for the first 400m.
- Ladders: 200m race pace, 200m easy then 400m race pace, 400m easy then 800m race pace, 800m easy, and back down 400m race pace, 400m easy, 200m race pace, 200m easy
- Hill sprints: Run up a hill, jog / walk down. Repeat 6-8 times

### Cross Training
- Cycling
- Lifting
- Pilates
- Bodyweight workouts (esp. lower body focused): Glute bridges, squats, lunges, clamshells, calf raises, etc.
