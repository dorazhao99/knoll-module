## What is Knoll?  
Knoll is a system that integrates external knowledge into AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude through customizable modules.  

## Adding Knowledge to Knoll  

### How can I add knowledge to Knoll?  
There are two ways to add knowledge in Knoll:  
1. Personal Module (Private & Local): Store your own knowledge by clipping text from the web or manually entering information.  
2. Collaborative Modules: Import shared modules created by others from the [Explore Page](https://knollapp.com/explore).  

### How do I add information to my Personal Module?  
- Clip relevant text from the internet by highlighting it, right-clicking (or Control-clicking on Mac), and selecting "Clip Selected Text".  
- Alternatively, manually add text using the browser extension.  
- View and manage your Personal Module within the browser extension.  

#### Why am I getting an error when adding a large clipping?  
- Clippings must be 500KB or smaller. If your clipping exceeds this, split it into multiple smaller clippings.  
- You can store up to 5MB of information in your Personal Module.  

#### How do I share clippings?  
- Click the "Share" icon in the Personal Module tab.  
- Share by copying the text or creating a GitHub Gist (requires linking your GitHub account).  

## Importing Existing Modules  
### How do I enable or add a module?  
- To enable a module, check the box next to it and save.  
- To add a new module, navigate to the Add Page (format: `https://knollapp.com/add/...`) for the module and click the "Add" button.  

### I created a Collaborative Module. How can I share it with others?  
You can share your module in two ways:  
1. Direct Link: Share the Add Page link (format: `https://knollapp.com/add/...`). Find this on the My Modules page (https://knollapp.com/user).  
2. Explore Page: Submit your module for public access by emailing [info@knollapp.com](mailto:info@knollapp.com) with the module link.  

### How do I update a Collaborative Module I’ve imported?  
Click "Update" in the Imported Modules tab of the extension to refresh your stored knowledge and ensure you have the latest version.  

## Using Knoll While Chatting  

### Which AI chatbots support Knoll?  
Knoll works with ChatGPT and Claude. For the best experience, we recommend:  
- ChatGPT Pro / Plus  
- Claude Pro / Team / Enterprise  
If you'd like to integrate Knoll with another AI model, email us with your request.  

### How does Knoll choose which modules to use?  
Knoll selects knowledge based on relevance to your query. Both your Personal Module and any active Collaborative Modules can be used.  

### How do I manage which modules ChatGPT or Claude can access?  
- Open the Imported Modules tab in the browser extension.  
- Check the modules you want to activate and uncheck the ones you don’t.  
- Click "Update" to save your preferences.  

### What if irrelevant modules keep getting added to my query?  
Knoll prioritizes comprehensive recall to ensure no relevant knowledge is missed. If irrelevant modules keep appearing:  
- Turn off the module via the browser extension.  
- Delete specific clippings in your Personal Module.  

## Creating Collaborative Modules  

### How do I create a Collaborative Module?  
Knoll can use Google Docs or GitHub Markdown files as Collaborative Modules. Ensure your document is publicly viewable, then:  
- Go to the [Create Page](https://knollapp.com/create).  
- Upload your document as a new module.
