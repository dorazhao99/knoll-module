## What is Knoll? 
Knoll is a system designed to integrate external knowledge into AI-powered chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude) through customizable modules.
 
## Adding Knowledge to Knoll
### How can I add knowledge in Knoll?
There are two ways for you to add knowledge with Knoll. 
1. The first is in your *Personal Module*, which is locally stored and private. You can add to your Personal Module by clipping text on the web or by manually entering in information.
2. The second is through importing *Collaborative Modules*. Examples of Collaborative Modules can be found on the Explore Page (https://knollapp.com/explore). 
 
### How do I add information into my Personal Module?
You can add information to your Personal Module by clipping relevant text on the Internet. Highlight any text you want to add, right-click (or Control-click on Mac), and select the "Clip Selected Text" option that appears. You can also manually add text to your Personal Module via the browser extension. View all information in your Personal Module by navigating to your browser extension. 

#### Why am I getting an error when trying to add a large clipping?
Clippings can be at most 500KB in size. If you want to add a larger clipping, we recommend splitting it into multiple clippings. You can store at most 5MB of information in your Personal Module. 

#### How do I share clippings?
You can share information you have clipped by clicking on the "Share" icon in the Personal Module tab of the browser extension. You can either copy the text to your clipboard or share by creating a Github Gist. To share via Gist, you will need to link your Github account.  

### Importing Existing Module
To enable a module, click the checkbox and save. Start chatting with ChatGPT. 
To add a module, click the plus button on the top left corner of the app. Input the URL to your module markdown file to add it. 
You must have access privileges to the module on Github in order to add it. 

#### I made a Collaborative Module. How do I share it with my friends?
You can share Collaborative Modules in two ways. First, you can send your friends a link to the Add Page for your module (of the format https://knollapp.com/add/...). To access the Add Page, navigate to the My Modules page (https://knollapp.com/user) and click on the Collaborative Module that you want to share. Second, you can add your module to the gallery on the Explore Page. Doing so means that your module will be publicly accessible. Please email info@knollapp.com with the link to your module if you are interested in featuring it on the Explore Page. 

#### There were updates to my Collaborative Module. How do I make sure I am accessing the most recent version of the document?
If there are updates to a Collaborative Module, you can refresh the knowledge stored in your repository by clicking the "Update" button in the Imported Modules tab of your extension. Doing this will automatically update the knowledge from the Collaborative Modules you have imported. 

## Using Knoll when chatting 
You can use Knoll when chatting with either ChatGPT or Claude. For the best experience, we recommend that you use either ChatGPT Pro / Plus or Claude Pro / Team / or Enterprise. If you are interested in integrating Knoll with another model provider, please email us with your request. 

### How are modules selected to be used? 
Any Collaborative Module that you have activated and your Personal Module could be added. Behind the scenes, we have a mechanism for selecting the knowledge that is relevant to your query. 

### I want to change what modules ChatGPT / Claude has access to. How do I do that?
You can turn on and off modules using the Imported Modules tab in the browser extension. You can check the modules you want activated and uncheck the modules you do not want activated. Then click "Update" to save your results. 

### Modules that are irrelvant to my prompt keep getting added. What do I do?
We designed Knoll to prioritize recall of your knowledge, meaning that we do not miss potentially relevant information. If you find that irrelvant information keeps getting added, we recommend that you "turn off" the module via the browser extension. You can also delete clippings in your Personal Module.
